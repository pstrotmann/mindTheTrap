# mindTheTrap
Here we store a collection of possible traps someone could fall into contributing to a proof event.
It is a helper repo not dedicated to one particualar proof event but rather a reusable store to support all proof events
due to Gowers' suggested idea of a "Treasury".
I'm not sure until now wether we should use many helper repos or one structured repo to store the different types of treasures (traps, best practices, ...)
that should be considered in proving. For now I prefer the bijection: One type <-> one repository (treasury)
